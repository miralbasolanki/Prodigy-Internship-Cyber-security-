Hello I am Miralba Solanki.
Welcome to my GitHub repository! 
This project marks the beginning of my journey in the Prodigy Internship for Cyber Security. 
As my first task, I am excited to delve into various aspects of cyber security, applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. 
This repository will serve as a documentation of my progress and the tasks I undertake throughout this internship. 
I look forward to expanding my skill set and contributing to the field of cyber security through this learning experience.



Task:1 "Create a python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the
caesar cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to 
perform encryption and decyption."
